# gymecs

GymECS is a simple python ECS system developped to facilitate the implementation and experimentation of deep RL techniques in video games. 

The ECS is associated with a blog that explains step by step how to create such a software. The repository will thus evolve at the same speed than the blog -- see [https://ludc.github.io/video_games_and_deep_reinforcement_learning/](https://ludc.github.io/video_games_and_deep_reinforcement_learning/)

Each branch of the repository is associated with a particular blog post, and then `main` branch correspond to the most recent post.

## Installation

Just `pip install -e .` would work, on Linux, Windows and MacOS.

## Citation

If you are using the ECS, please refer to this website or use the following citation:

```
  @misc{gymecs,
        author = {Ludovic Denoyer},
        title = {gymECS: An entity component system for deep reinforcement learning},
        year = {2022},
        howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/ludc/gymecs}},
    }

```
